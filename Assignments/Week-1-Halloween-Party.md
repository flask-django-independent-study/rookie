# Halloween Party | Learning Routing & Templating

This week we're learning about using Flask to create a server, and build routes! You can think of routes
like locations on a website.

### This week, you'll learn:

  1. How to build a multi-page site using Flask
  2. Serve HTML templates to show content on your webpage!
  3. The basics of Flask syntax, and Jinja2, a templating engine.

#### Once you've looked at the resources in Lessons, come back here to get started!

1. Clone the starting code:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/flask-django-independent-study/week-1-rookie-halloween-party
```

2. Open the repository:

```zsh
cd week-1-rookie-halloween-party
```

3. Set up your virtual environment. You don't have to know what this means yet, we'll cover it soon. Basically,
this is a way to install dependencies within your project's "sandbox", without needing to install everything from
every project on your local machine.

```zsh
python3 -m venv env
```

4. Install requirements (in this case, you'll be installing Flask):

```zsh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Activate your virtual environment:

```zsh
source bin/env/activate
```

6. The starting code won't do anything yet, but when you need to run the code, you can run:

```zsh
python3 app.py
```

Make sure you're cd'd into your project directory!
