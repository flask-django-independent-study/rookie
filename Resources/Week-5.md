# Flask Login

Resources serve as a guide to orient your direction.
You do not need to read or watch all the resources.
They are simply here to serve you.

## Demo & Source Code

*Please try to complete the assignment and troubleshoot on your own before checking out the finished code. When you're done, this is a great way to see if we solved things the same way, but don't use this as a resource to copy, you won't learn as much as solving problems and looking things up on your own when you get stuck.*
